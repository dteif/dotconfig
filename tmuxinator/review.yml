# The following `args-*` fields are not part of tmuxinator, but they are used to perform
# some kind of input validation and/or inject default settings.
# 
# Available input arguments are:
#
# - `branch` git branch to be reviewed (default: 'main')
# - `v` vertical layout. Set it equal to anything (e.g. `v=true`) to switch from
#       an horizontal to a vertical layout. 
args-branch: "<% @settings['branch'] ||= 'main' %>"
args-layout: "<% @settings['layout'] = @settings['v'] ? 'vertical' : 'horizontal' %>"
args-path: "<% @settings['path'] ||= '.config' %>"
