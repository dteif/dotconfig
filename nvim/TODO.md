## Lsp

      Is formatting doable only by means of lsp? Solve this.
- [x] Open LSP references (telescope?) with keymap. 
- [x] Is it possible to open cmp help when e.g. editing object properties, before any string is entered (maybe I
      don't remember which keys are present and I want a help, as in vscode triggered by <C-Space> or <Cmd-i>).
